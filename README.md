# Task4

I designed this sales dashboard in Power BI using a cleaned sales dataset containing order details like sales, order_id, year, region, segment, and category.
First, I created DAX measures to calculate KPIs such as Total Orders, Average Sales, and Total Revenue, which I displayed using styled KPI cards.
Then, I built a series of visualizations — including donut charts, bar charts, and column charts — to show sales trends by year, customer segments, regions, and product categories.
I customized the layout with a clean white background, dark KPI cards, consistent font styling, and color themes to maintain a minimal, professional look similar to the provided dashboard design.
